# Next.js Project

## Getting Started
Run npm install to install dependencies for this project

## File structure
The public folder contains all the image assets, and can be accesed in image tags using\
`<img src='/filename.png' alt='some image'>`\
Note that files within the public folder can be automatically referenced using just `/` as the base url\\

The `src` folder contains all the code required to run the project. `app` contains all the information required for [routing](https://github.com/JimmyALiu/iMuslims/edit/migrate-nextjs/README.md#routing). `components` contains all the react components that don't require a route (those go in `app`), and `styles` contains the global CSS styles.
